        1   How have if-blocks  been translated into GIMPLE  statements? Can you
            differentiate between conditional and unconditional gotos?
	Ans.	   If-else blocks are also called as conditional statements.
            These blocks are simplified into various sections of code with
            labels as the temporary variable having local scope. Control  transfer
            occurs with unconditional jumps like "goto X" or conditional jump "if 
	    Z then goto X else goto Y".

        2   Repeat  the  above compilation,  but  now  asking for  another  dump
            that  of  the pass  "cfg".  View  this  pass  and say  whether  this
            representation makes it easier to  read and understand GIMPLEs. Draw
            the control-flow graph  of the program A-2.c on a  piece of paper by
            looking at the CFG dump.

                f ()
                {
                  int c;
                  int b;
                  int a;
                  int Z.0;
                  int D.1715;

                <bb 2>:
                  a = Z;
                  if (a <= 9)
                    goto <bb 3>;
                  else
                    goto <bb 4>;

                <bb 3>:
                  b = 5;
                  c = 17;
                  goto <bb 6>;

                <bb 4>:
                  b = 6;
                  c = 20;
                  if (a == 0)
                    goto <bb 5>;
                  else
                    goto <bb 6>;

                <bb 5>:
                  c = 0;

                <bb 6>:
                  D.1715 = b * 10;
                  Z.0 = D.1715 + c;
                  Z = Z.0;
                  return;

                }
                  
		The control-flow  graph dump shows  distinct basic blocks  which are
            named sequentially starting from  1. Basic blocks roughly correspond
            to  labels that  are created  during the  gimplification of  control
            statements.
